Questionable Cards
=================

Repo for running the site http://questionablecards.com

The app requires it runs under the root of a server so in order to not have to get all funny with Apache virtual hosts we can use a built-in PHP web server.

Make sure you are in the root folder of the project and run the following command (requires PHP 5.4, http://php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php)

`php -S localhost:8000`

Then you can hit `localhost:8000` in your browser. Enjoy!
